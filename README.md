## A simple plugin of bans

This plugin was created for me to learn a little more about Android and how the network works.
The project is not finished yet, there is much more to add

## How will it work

The idea is quite simple: the plug-in will work like any other ban plug-in, but this one will have an Android app (not sure if I leave it for multiplatform) to control the plug-in and a integration with Discord.
